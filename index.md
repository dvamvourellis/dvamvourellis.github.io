## About

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science at Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Sciences. Before that, I earned a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. I am an aspiring data scientist, passionate about solving real-world problems with machine learning and statistics.

## Research

I am doing machine learning research at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io). Currently, I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models. Specifically, I am interested in building Bayesian deep learning models which provide reliable and useful uncertainty estimates, an essential property for downstream applications in high-risk domains (e.g. healthcare, judicial decisions). 

#### Recent Work

Théo Guénais, Dimitris Vamvourellis, Yaniv Yacoby, Finale Doshi-Velez, Weiwei Pan, *BaCOUn: Bayesian Classifier with OOD Uncertainty*, Accepted by ICML Workshop on Uncertainty and Robustness in Deep Learning, 2020.

## Work Experience

Currently, I am working as a data scientist for[intelligencia.ai](https://www.intelligencia.ai/), building Natural Language Processing models to uncover trends and emerging areas of innovation in clinical research. Prior to that, I worked in the fintech industry for BlackRock, where I developed subject matter expertise on the quantitative capabilities of the Aladdin platform like stress testing, portfolio optimization and portfolio risk modelling tools.
