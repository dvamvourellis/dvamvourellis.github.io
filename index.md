## About

In December 2020, I graduated with a Masters in Data Science from Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Sciences. Before that, I graduated first in my class with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. I am passionate about solving real-world problems with machine learning and statistics.

## Research

I conducted machine learning research at Harvard's [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io), focusing on uncertainty estimation for deep models. Specifically, I am interested in building Bayesian deep learning models which provide reliable and useful uncertainty estimates, an essential property for downstream applications in high-risk domains.

## Work Experience

Currently, I am working as Quantitative Researcher at BlackRock's Investment AI Group, developing machine learning and NLP solutions to aid investment processes. Previously, I worked as a data scientist for [intelligencia.ai](https://www.intelligencia.ai/), building Natural Language Processing models to uncover trends and emerging areas of innovation in clinical research. Prior to that, I worked in the fintech industry for BlackRock, where I developed subject matter expertise on the quantitative capabilities of the Aladdin platform like stress testing, portfolio optimization and portfolio risk modelling tools.


## Recent Projects
- Developing a multi-agent GenAI framework facilitating the interaction of portfolio managers and traders with analytics and models through a simple language interfaces. The framework includes AI-powered SQL and Python generators and is able to decompose complex multi-step queries into a series of tasks which require planning and reasoning over data and analytics.

- Developed an LLM [(application)](https://rehearsal-ai.streamlit.app/) for creating hypothetical debates between two [(CAMEL)](https://www.camel-ai.org/) agents. The app can be used to rehearse a conversation you are interested in between two given roles (e.g. negotiate with your manager) and find potentially useful arguments and counterarguments on a given topic.

- Predicting flu rates across US states [(github repo)](https://github.com/benlevyx/modelling-infectious-disease).
  - Built recurrent neural networks to forecast flu rates across US for multiple weeks into the future.
  - Used a hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze the impact of various socioeconomic and environmental factors on flu rates across different states.
  
- Predicting public opinion in the 2020 Democratic Primaries using Twitter [#tweetpoll](https://benlevyx.github.io/twitter-polling/).
  - Developed recurrent neural networks to perform sentiment analysis on two million relevant tweets.
  - Created a Bayesian model to infer the popularity of each candidate based on the sentiment of tweets referring to this candidate.

- [Mining Biomedical Text: Transfer Learning to the Rescue](https://medium.com/institute-for-applied-computational-science/mining-biomedical-text-transfer-learning-to-the-rescue-d502029314c3)
  - Used BioBERT to mine relations between genes and diseases from massive medical literature, constructing a knowledge graph from unstructured text.
