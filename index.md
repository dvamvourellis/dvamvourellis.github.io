## About

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science at Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Sciences. Before that, I earned a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. I am an aspiring data scientist, passionate about solving real-world problems with machine learning and statistics.

## Research

I am doing machine learning research at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io). Currently, I am interested in uncertainty estimation for deep models. Specifically, I am interested in building Bayesian deep learning models which provide reliable and useful uncertainty estimates, which is essential for downstream applications in high-risk domains (e.g. healthcare, judicial decisions).
