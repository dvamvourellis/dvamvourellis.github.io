Currently, I am working as Quantitative Researcher at BlackRock’s Investment AI Group, developing machine learning and NLP solutions to aid investment processes. Previously, I worked as a data scientist for [Intelligencia AI](https://www.intelligencia.ai/), building Natural Language Processing models to uncover trends and emerging areas of innovation in clinical research

In December 2020, I graduated with a Masters in Data Science from Harvard’s Institute for Applied Computational Sciences, where I conducted machine learning research at [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io/), focusing on uncertainty estimation for deep models. Before that, I graduated first in my class with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.
